# Getting Started

Pick the scenario that matches what you want to do. Each path links to the
detailed guide you need — you do not have to read everything.

## 1. I just want to run a node

A relay is already running somewhere on your network and you want to connect
a node to it.

→ **[node/concept.md](node/concept.md)** — what a node is (one type,
  differentiated by capabilities).
→ **[node/setup.md](node/setup.md)** — register the node, get approved,
  publish a capability profile, start the daemon.
→ **[node/token-lifecycle.md](node/token-lifecycle.md)** — keep tokens
  fresh.
→ **[node/capabilities.md](node/capabilities.md)** — define what the node
  can do.

You do **not** need the server guides for this path.

## 2. I want a relay + one node (single-host cluster)

You are setting up the whole thing on one machine (or one relay + one node
on the same LAN).

1. → **[server/setup.md](server/setup.md)** — install the relay, create the
   master seed, bootstrap the first admin, start the server.
2. → **[server/admin.md](server/admin.md)** — approve the node once it has
   registered.
3. → **[node/setup.md](node/setup.md)** — register the node, start the
   daemon.
4. → **[concepts.md](concepts.md)** — read this once to understand the
   mental model.

## 3. I want a multi-node cluster

You are building a real cluster: one relay, several nodes, possibly across
hosts or containers.

1. → **[server/setup.md](server/setup.md)** — relay install, HTTPS via a
   reverse proxy (§9), database + backups (§10), config reference (§11),
   systemd (§13).
2. → **[concepts.md](concepts.md)** — architecture, capabilities, tokens,
   the self-care pattern, and the glossary.
3. → **[node/concept.md](node/concept.md)** — what a node is.
4. → **[node/capability-concept.md](node/capability-concept.md)** — what a
   capability is.
5. → **[node/setup.md](node/setup.md)** — per node (repeat for each).
6. → **[reference/api.md](reference/api.md)** — full endpoint reference
   with cURL examples, payloads, and error codes.
7. → **[reference/design-board.md](reference/design-board.md)** — if you
   plan to run the message board (db-node + board-worker).

## 4. I want to use the API / write a client

→ **[reference/api.md](reference/api.md)** — every endpoint, auth
  requirements, cURL examples, and the common error codes.
→ **[concepts.md](concepts.md)** — credential families and lifecycle.

## 5. I want to understand the concepts

→ **[node/concept.md](node/concept.md)** — what a node is.
→ **[node/capability-concept.md](node/capability-concept.md)** — what a
  capability is.
→ **[concepts.md](concepts.md)** — the relay, tokens, self-care pattern,
  status system, glossary.
→ **[reference/design-board.md](reference/design-board.md)** — the complete
  feature catalogue (22 categories, ~150 features, each with a file/line
  reference to its implementation).

## Quick decision tree

```
What do you want to do?
│
├─ Run a node (relay already exists)        → node/concept.md, node/setup.md
│
├─ Set up the relay
│   ├─ Just me + one node                   → server/setup.md, then node/setup.md
│   └─ A real cluster                       → server/setup.md, concepts.md, node/setup.md, reference/api.md
│
├─ Use the HTTP API / write a client        → reference/api.md
│
├─ Browse every feature / find an implementation  → reference/design-board.md
│
└─ Understand the architecture              → node/concept.md, node/capability-concept.md, concepts.md
```

## Quick API walkthrough

These three calls cover the core flow: register a node, wait for approval, and refresh the token.

```bash
# 1. Register a node
curl -X POST "http://${RELAY_HOST}:8788/relay/v2/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"node_name": "test-node", "endpoint": null, "role": "node"}' | tee /tmp/register.json

# 2. Poll until approved (admin must approve in the dashboard)
curl -X POST "http://${RELAY_HOST}:8788/relay/v2/auth/status" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -c '{node_id, registration_secret}' /tmp/register.json)"

# 3. After approval: obtain a runtime token
curl -X POST "http://${RELAY_HOST}:8788/relay/v2/auth/refresh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -c '{node_id, registration_secret, requested_credential: "runtime_token"}' /tmp/register.json)"
```

See [reference/api.md](reference/api.md) for the full endpoint table.
