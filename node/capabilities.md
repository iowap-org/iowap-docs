# Capabilities

Capabilities are the routing keys the relay uses to match stages to nodes.
A node advertises its capabilities in every heartbeat; the scheduler matches
capability names **exactly**.

## Defining capabilities

Capabilities may be sent as objects or plain strings:

```json
{ "capabilities": ["chat.ai", "code.ai"] }
```

```json
{ "capabilities": [{"name": "chat.ai", "version": "1.0.0"}] }
```

A node can change what it offers at runtime by sending different capabilities
in subsequent heartbeats. The scheduler always uses the most recent heartbeat.

## Naming & suffixes

Capability names are lowercase, dot-separated namespaces. The suffix
describes *how* the node executes the stage and is **required** for every
concrete capability a node advertises — a bare core name such as `chat` or
`storage.archive` is a category, not an executable offer.

| Suffix | Meaning | Required for | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.native` | Runs directly on the node, no local AI. | **Nodes without local AI.** | `storage.archive.native`, `db.board.create.native` |
| `.ai` | Delegates to a local AI or LLM for reasoning. | Nodes with local AI. | `chat.ai`, `code.ai`, `board.reply.generate.ai` |
| `.relay` | Relay-internal orchestration capability. | Relay-internal stages only. | `llm.decide_cleanup.relay` |

> **Rule of thumb:** if a node has no local AI, **all** of its capabilities
> carry the `.native` suffix — including database/service nodes like the
> db-node (`db.board.create.native`, `db.post.read.native`, …). The relay
> matches capability names **exactly**, so advertising `db.board.create`
> when a stage requests `db.board.create.native` will not match.

Capability names are matched **exactly**: a stage requesting `chat.ai` is only
claimed by a node whose latest heartbeat advertised `chat.ai`.

## Heartbeat with capabilities

```bash
curl -X POST "http://${RELAY_HOST}:8788/relay/v2/discovery/heartbeat" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer rt_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "available": true,
    "load": 0.0,
    "queue_depth": 0,
    "capabilities": [{"name": "chat.ai", "version": "1.0.0"}]
  }'
```

`endpoint` is set during registration; send it again only if it changed at
runtime.

## Capability types

Every capability has a **type** that describes *how* work is executed:

| Type | Suffix | Execution | Example |
|------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **With reasoning** | `.ai` | Delegated to a local AI (Hermes, LLM). The AI interprets the payload, chooses tools, and returns a result. | `chat.ai`, `agent.ai`, `code.ai` |
| **Without reasoning / tool** | `.native` | Direct execution — a script, binary, or hard-coded handler. No AI involved. | `storage.archive.native`, `image.generate.mflux` |

A single node can offer **both** types side by side. For example, a worker
might advertise `chat.ai` (with reasoning, handled by Hermes) and
`image.generate.mflux` (tool, runs FLUX directly) in the same heartbeat.
The handler for each capability decides how work is executed — the node-cli
daemon is agnostic to the type.

## chat.ai vs agent.ai

Both are capabilities with reasoning (`.ai` suffix), but they serve different purposes:

| | `chat.ai` | `agent.ai` |
|---|---|---|
| **Backend** | `hermes -z` (subprocess) | Hermes API Server (HTTP) |
| **Session** | None — new session every call | Persistent session across calls |
| **Context** | Only the current prompt | Can maintain multi-turn context |
| **Tools** | Limited to what `-z` provides | Full Hermes toolset |
| **Use case** | Simple, stateless queries ("What time is it?") | Complex multi-step workflows ("Update the worker and restart") |
| **Latency** | Higher (process startup each time) | Lower (server stays running) |

**When to use which:**

- `chat.ai` — quick questions, simple prompts, no tool access needed.
  The handler runs `hermes -z "<prompt>"` and returns the response.

- `agent.ai` — complex tasks that require planning, tool use, or
  multi-step execution ("git pull, check capabilities, restart daemon").
  The handler sends the payload to a local Hermes API Server
  (`http://localhost:8642/v1/chat/completions`) which keeps a persistent
  session and has access to all tools.

**What is the Hermes API Server?**

The Hermes API Server is an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server that is part of
`hermes gateway`. It exposes the full Hermes agent
as a REST API — tools, skills, memory, cron, and multi-turn sessions.

- **Default port:** `8642`
- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:8642/v1`
- **Endpoints:** `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/runs`,
  `/v1/models`, `/v1/capabilities`, `/health`
- **Auth:** Bearer token (`API_SERVER_KEY`)
- **Config:** `API_SERVER_ENABLED=true` in `.env` or config.yaml
- **Start:** `hermes gateway`

Any frontend that speaks the OpenAI API format (Open WebUI, LobeChat,
LibreChat, etc.) can connect to it.

> **Full documentation:** [Hermes API Server](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/api-server)

**Example `agent.ai` capability profile:**

```yaml
- name: agent.ai
  type: ai
  description: "Full Hermes agent with persistent session and all tools."
  auto_publish: true
  claimable: true
  handler: /opt/relay/handlers/agent-handler.sh
  max_parallel: 1
  timeout: 600
  input_schema:
    fields:
      task:
        name: task
        type: string
        required: true
        description: "The task description for the agent to execute."
```

The `agent-handler.sh` would POST to the local Hermes API Server
instead of running `hermes -z`:

## node-cli capability profiles

The generic `node-cli` daemon is **capability-agnostic**: all capabilities are
defined in external YAML profiles. The daemon reads only
`~/.relay/node.yaml`; working profiles live in
`~/.relay/profiles.d/`.

```yaml
capabilities:
  - name: chat.ai
    version: "1.0.0"
    type: ai                              # optional: ai | tool | script | workflow | resource
    description: "General conversational AI — accepts a prompt, question, or message and returns a text response."
    auto_publish: true                    # include in every heartbeat
    claimable: true                       # daemon may claim stages for this capability
    handler: /opt/relay/handlers/chat-ai.sh   # required when claimable: true
    max_parallel: 2                       # in-flight handler limit (default: 1)
    timeout: 300                          # handler timeout in seconds (default: 300)
    input_schema:                         # optional, documents expected payload fields
      fields:
        prompt:
          name: prompt
          type: string
          required: false
          description: "The main instruction or request for the AI."
        message:
          name: message
          type: string
          required: false
          description: "Alternative to prompt — a short message or greeting."
```

### Node-level configuration (T-087)

The active file (`~/.relay/node.yaml`) is also the home of **node-level
configuration**. The `capabilities` array is optional — a profile may
carry only node-level fields. The following top-level keys are
recognised:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `status` | Operator-requested node status (`busy` / `idle` / `online`). Written by `node-cli node busy` / `idle` / `clear-status`; the next heartbeat forwards it to the server. |
| `node_name` | Optional node-name override (forwarded in the heartbeat; also read from `ai-relay-agent.json`). |
| `description` | Optional free-form node description (forwarded in the heartbeat). |
| `capabilities` | Optional list of capability entries (see above). |

A minimal profile that only pins the node to `busy` is therefore valid:

```yaml
status: busy
```

The schema allows additional top-level keys (`additionalProperties: true`),
so forward-compatible fields do not break validation.

### Capability dashboard pages (SSN)

A capability can have its own HTML dashboard page. Since T-069 these pages
are **hosted by a Server-Side Node (SSN)** that advertises the
`ssn.capability-pages` capability — the relay no longer stores or serves
capability pages itself. Workers manage their pages by sending tasks to
`ssn.capability-pages` (`add`/`update`/`delete`/`list`). See
[ssn.md](ssn.md) for the full flow, payload formats and deployment.

### Dynamic Node Routes (T-075)

Since T-075, nodes can declare **API routes** in their capability YAML.
These routes are registered dynamically when the node heartbeats and
deregistered when the node goes offline. The relay proxies requests
from the dashboard to the node's upstream service.

Routes are defined per capability in the `routes:` block:

```yaml
capabilities:
  - name: ssn.capability-pages
    version: "1.0.0"
    routes:
      - path: /api/task-submit
        method: POST
        auth: session
        upstream: http://127.0.0.1:8790/api/task-submit
        description: "Submit a task via SSN proxy"
      - path: /api/tasks/{id}
        method: GET
        auth: session
        upstream: http://127.0.0.1:8790/api/tasks/{id}
      - path: /api/storage/{id}
        method: GET
        auth: session
        upstream: http://127.0.0.1:8790/api/storage/{id}
```

Each route has:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | ✅ | The sub-path, e.g. `/api/task-submit`. Path params like `{id}` are supported. |
| `method` | ✅ | HTTP method: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH` |
| `auth` | ❌ | Auth mode: `session` (Dashboard cookie, default), `node_token` (Bearer), `none` (public) |
| `upstream` | ✅ | Full URL the relay proxies to, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8790/api/task-submit` |
| `description` | ❌ | Human-readable description |

The route is reachable at:

```
/relay/v2/dashboard/api/node-routes/{node_id}/{path}
```

For example, a node with `node_id=3P4KEWGE` and a route `path=/api/task-submit`
is reachable at `POST /relay/v2/dashboard/api/node-routes/3P4KEWGE/api/task-submit`.

**Auth modes:**

- `session` — requires a valid dashboard session cookie. The relay validates
  the cookie and checks `dashboard:view` permission before proxying.
- `node_token` — requires a valid Bearer node token in the `Authorization` header.
- `none` — no authentication. Use with caution (only for public endpoints).

**Lifecycle:** Routes are registered on every heartbeat (DELETE + INSERT).
When a node goes offline (heartbeat timeout), all its routes are automatically
cleared. No manual cleanup needed.

**DELETE is not proxied.** The proxy handles `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and
`PATCH`. `DELETE` is reserved for unregistering a route (see temp routes
below) — a node that needs to expose a DELETE-capable upstream route must
register it under a different method.

#### Temporary bridge routes (T-123 – T-126)

Permanent routes (above) are replaced on every heartbeat. For large-file
handoff (storage upload/download channels) that is too eager — the route
would be wiped while the transfer is still running. **Temporary bridge
routes** live outside the heartbeat cycle, carry a TTL, and are tied to a
`channel_id`.

A node registers one via the task-driven register endpoint (Bearer
node-token auth, **not** a dashboard session):

```
POST /relay/v2/dashboard/api/node-routes/register
Authorization: Bearer rt-...
{
  "path": "/upload/abc123",
  "method": "POST",
  "ttl_seconds": 3600,
  "upstream": "http://storage-node:8791/upload/abc123",
  "channel_id": "ch_abc123",
  "description": "channel upload"
}
```

The route is stored with `auth = "node_token"`, an
`expires_at = now + ttl_seconds`, and the given `channel_id`. A later
heartbeat does **not** replace it (only permanent routes with
`expires_at IS NULL` are synced). The route is reaped automatically by the
`temp_route_cleanup` watchdog after it expires; the owner can also
revoke it early:

```
DELETE /relay/v2/dashboard/api/node-routes/{node_id}/{path}?method=POST
Authorization: Bearer rt-...
```

Path allowlist: temp routes must be under `/upload/` or `/download/` so a
compromised node cannot shadow arbitrary dashboard routes. The TTL is
capped by `temp_route_max_ttl_seconds` (default 24h). Node-side helpers:
`RelayClient.register_temp_route()` / `unregister_temp_route()`.

##### Manual management: `node-cli route` (T-136)

The `node-cli route` subcommand gives an operator manual control over a
node's own temp routes (the same endpoints the bridge handlers use
internally). Each subcommand has `--json` output for scripting.

```
# Open a temp route (1h TTL, tied to a channel_id).
node-cli route register --path /upload/x --method POST \
    --upstream http://storage-node:8791/upload/x \
    --ttl 3600 --channel ch_x [--description "note"]

# Revoke it before the TTL lapses.
node-cli route unregister --path /upload/x --method POST

# List all of this node's own routes (temp + permanent), with expires_at.
node-cli route list
```

`route list` calls `GET /api/node-routes` (Bearer node-token), which
returns only the calling node's routes — it cannot list another node's
routes.

##### Bridge upload/download channel flow (T-127 / T-128 / T-129)

The storage node exposes `storage.upload_channel` / `storage.download_channel`
as **claimable** tasks. A caller submits such a task; the storage node
claims it, and the handler:

1. Registers a temp bridge route (`POST /api/node-routes/register`)
   pointing at its local **bridge server** (`docker/nodes/storage/bridge_server.py`,
   T-128) — a small Starlette server on `0.0.0.0:8791` that only accepts
   requests from the relay server's IP (Source-IP-Allowlist middleware,
   resolved from `RELAY_URL` DNS; `RELAY_SERVER_IP` overrides).
2. Completes the task with `{upload_url|download_url, channel_id, ttl}`.

The caller then streams the large file through that URL. The relay proxy
(T-129) streams the request body (`request.stream()`) and the upstream
response (`client.send(stream=True)` + `StreamingResponse`) **chunkwise**
so large files never sit fully in the relay's RAM. The bridge server
streams the body onto the NAS (`POST /upload/{channel_id}`) or streams a
stored file back (`GET /download/{channel_id}`) — also chunkwise.

This keeps the relay a pure proxy: the file bytes flow caller → relay →
bridge server → NAS, never buffered as a single blob in any hop.

Publish flow:

```
Operator edits profiles.d/default.yaml
        ↓
node-cli capabilities validate default    ← validates without touching active
        ↓
node-cli capabilities publish default      ← atomic write to node.yaml + SIGHUP
        ↓
Daemon picks up change at next heartbeat (mtime check) or via SIGHUP
```

### Handler contract

A handler is an external subprocess. Environment variables `RELAY_STAGE_ID`,
`RELAY_TASK_ID`, `RELAY_CAPABILITY`, `RELAY_NODE_ID`, `RELAY_BASE_URL`,
`RELAY_TOKEN_FILE` are set. **Stdin** receives the stage payload as JSON;
**stdout** must be valid JSON (the result dict). The daemon captures
**stderr** and writes it to the daemon log for debugging — it is never sent
to the relay as the result.

| Outcome | What the daemon does | Result stored on the stage |
|---|---|---|
| Exit `0`, stdout is valid JSON | Complete the stage | The parsed stdout dict |
| Exit `0`, stdout is **not** valid JSON | Fail the stage (counted against `max_retries`) | `{"error": "handler stdout is not valid JSON: ..."}` |
| Exit non-zero (any code `N`) | Fail the stage (counted against `max_retries`) | `{"error": "handler exited with code N", "stderr": ...}` |
| Timeout exceeded | `SIGTERM` then `SIGKILL` after a short grace | `{"error": "handler timeout after Ns"}` |
| `SIGKILL` / host shutdown while claimed | The stage stays `claimed` until `claim_ttl_seconds` (default 60 s) elapses, then the scheduler releases it back to `pending` for another node to claim | — |

Key points:

- **stdout is the contract.** Only stdout is interpreted as the result.
  Write logs/diagnostics to stderr.
- **Exit codes are meaningful.** `0` = success, anything else = failure.
  A handler MUST exit with a non-zero code whenever it could not produce
  a valid result. Returning exit `0` with non-JSON or an `error`-keyed
  payload is a contract violation: the daemon treats exit `0` as
  success, completes the stage with the (broken) result, and the
  scheduler will not retry it — the failed work is silently lost.
- **exit `0` requires valid JSON on stdout.** Handlers may only write a
  valid JSON result object to stdout when they exit `0`. Any other
  output (empty, prose, error text) is a contract violation and is
  recorded as an error result on the stage.
- **Timeouts don't hang the daemon.** The handler is killed and the stage
  is failed with a clear error message; the scheduler re-queues it (up to
  `max_retries`, default 2 → 3 attempts total). Once the budget is
  exhausted the stage is marked `failed` permanently and the owning task
  is failed too when all its stages are terminal.
- **Crash safety.** If the daemon itself is killed mid-claim, the stage is
  not lost — the relay's claim-TTL watchdog releases it automatically. No
  manual intervention needed. If the node stays offline, the heartbeat
  watchdog eventually fails the orphaned `claimed` stage so it does not
  stay pending forever (T-061).

### Validation rules

A profile is invalid if: YAML syntax error, `capabilities` present but
not a list, any capability missing `name`, duplicate names, `claimable:
true` without `handler`, `max_parallel`/`timeout` not positive
integers, `auto_publish`/`claimable` not boolean, or `version` not
a non-empty string. The `capabilities` array itself is **optional**
(T-087) — a profile may carry only node-level configuration (`status`,
`node_name`, `description`). The optional `description` field is
preserved through the pipeline and forwarded to the relay in
heartbeats.
On error the active profile is never touched.

### Capability metadata forwarded to the server (T-053)

The daemon's heartbeat includes the following fields for each advertised
capability, when they are present in the YAML profile:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `name`, `version` | Capability identity (always sent) |
| `available` | Computed from `max_parallel` vs. in-flight stages |
| `type` | Capability type (`ai`, `tool`, `script`, `workflow`, `resource`) |
| `description` | Human-readable description |
| `input_schema` | Expected payload fields (documented below) |
| `upload_modes` | T-164: supported file-transfer modes — list of `inline` / `artifact` / `bridge` (documented below) |

The server stores `description`, `type`, `input_schema` and `upload_modes`
in the normalized `node_capabilities` index. When a node claims a stage or
queries a task, the scheduler resolves `capability_details` inline so
the claiming handler sees the expected payload shape without an extra
discovery round-trip:

```json
"capability_details": {
  "name": "chat.ai",
  "type": "ai",
  "description": "General conversational AI — accepts a prompt, ...",
  "input_schema": { "fields": { "prompt": { "type": "string", "required": false } } },
  "upload_modes": ["inline", "artifact", "bridge"]
}
```

For the full `node-cli` command reference see [node-cli-reference.md](node-cli-reference.md).

## Node-level `node_name` + `description` (T-072)

Beyond per-capability metadata, a node can advertise **node-level** fields
that describe the node as a whole. These are top-level keys in the
node's meta file (`ai-relay-agent.json`):

```json
{
  "node_id": "84K73W47",
  "node_name": "hermes-worker-1",
  "description": "Primary Hermes worker — runs chat.ai, code.ai, agent.ai.",
  ...
}
```

The `node-cli` daemon reads `node_name` and `description` from the meta
file on every heartbeat and forwards them to the server. The server
updates the `nodes` table so the values survive across heartbeats and
are visible to other nodes.

- `node_name` overrides the name originally set during registration.
- `description` is free-form prose (max 1024 chars) shown by
  `node-cli node list` (truncated to 60 chars) and `node-cli node info`
  (full text).

Both fields are optional; omitting them leaves the existing values
untouched.

## `upload_modes` — Datei-Übertragungs-Treppe (T-164)

A capability that accepts or serves files can declare which transfer modes
it supports via the `upload_modes` field. The node-cli's `file send` /
`file get` subcommands read this list (plus the server's ladder config
`max_inline_bytes` / `max_artifact_bytes`) and pick the smallest mode that
fits the file size and is supported by the capability.

| Mode | Meaning | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `inline` | File is base64-encoded and carried in the task payload (`data_base64`) | Small files (≤ `max_inline_bytes`, default 5 MB). No storage node needed, but RAM-heavy on the handler. |
| `artifact` | File is uploaded to the transient relay artifact store; the task payload carries an `artifact_id` reference | Medium files (≤ `max_artifact_bytes`, default 50 MB). Store is transient (TTL, T-165), not an archive. |
| `bridge` | File is streamed directly to/from a storage node through a temp bridge route; the task payload carries a `storage_ref` (`{type, id, filename}`) | Large files (> `max_artifact_bytes`). RAM-bounded, needs a storage node with a bridge server. |

**Default:** when a capability does not declare `upload_modes`, the full
ladder `[inline, artifact, bridge]` is assumed (backcompat — a capability
that never heard of the ladder behaves as before).

**YAML example:**

```yaml
- name: storage.store
  upload_modes: [inline, artifact, bridge]
  input_schema:
    fields:
      path: { type: string, required: true }
      data_base64: { type: string, required: false }
      artifact_id: { type: string, required: false }
```

**Narrow capability (no bridge, e.g. a small embedded node):**

```yaml
- name: storage.fetch
  upload_modes: [inline, bridge]
```

A capability that only ever handles small payloads can restrict to
`[inline]`; `file send` will then refuse files larger than
`max_inline_bytes` with a "file too big" error instead of silently
falling back to a mode the handler cannot process.

### `storage_ref` contract (T-164)

When `file send` picks the `bridge` mode, the task payload carries a
`storage_ref` field instead of `data_base64` / `artifact_id`:

```json
{
  "path": "projects/2026/file.png",
  "storage_ref": { "type": "channel", "id": "ch_abc", "filename": "file.png" }
}
```

`type` is `"channel"` (storage.upload_channel) or `"backup"`
(backup.create mode=bridge). The receiving node resolves the ref and
streams the file from the storage node via `file get` / bridge download.
See also [storage.md](storage.md).
