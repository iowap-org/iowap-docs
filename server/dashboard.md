# Relay — Dashboard Guide

The Relay dashboard is a web interface for managing nodes, users, tasks, and
tokens. It is available at:

```
http://${RELAY_HOST}:8788/relay/v2/dashboard/
```

Replace `${RELAY_HOST}` with the relay IP, hostname, or mDNS name.

For the credential concepts behind dashboard login see
[../concepts.md](../concepts.md). For admin operations see
[admin.md](admin.md). For server installation see [setup.md](setup.md).

## 1. First login and bootstrap

Before any human user exists, the cluster must be bootstrapped with a master
admin seed. The master seed is the emergency root credential. It can only be
created from the command line on the relay host, never through the HTTP API.

### 1.1 Initialize the master seed (command line)

Log in to the relay host and run:

```bash
relay-server admin init-master
```

The command prints the seed once:

```text
adm_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Store it in a password manager. It cannot be shown again.

### 1.2 Log in with the master seed and create the first admin

1. Open the dashboard login page
2. Choose **Master seed** and paste the seed
3. You are redirected to the **Create First Admin** page
4. Enter a username (and optional email)
5. The dashboard shows a generated temporary password — store it securely
6. Log out and log in again with the new admin username
7. The system forces you to change the password before you can continue

After the first human admin is created, master-seed login is automatically
disabled until recovery mode is explicitly enabled.

### 1.3 Recovery mode

If all human admins are locked out:

1. On the relay host, deactivate all admin accounts:

   ```bash
   relay-recovery --db-path ~/.relay/server.db enable-recovery --all
   ```

2. Restart the server with recovery mode enabled:

   ```bash
   RELAY_ENABLE_MASTER_SEED_LOGIN=true relay-server server --port 8788
   ```

3. Log in with the master seed and bootstrap a new admin
4. After the new admin changed the temporary password, restart the server
   without `RELAY_ENABLE_MASTER_SEED_LOGIN=true`

See [admin.md](admin.md) for the recovery rationale.

## 2. Human users

For daily administration, create human users with limited permissions. This is
safer than always using the master seed.

### 2.1 Create a user

In the dashboard, go to **Users → New user** and enter:

- Username (unique, no spaces)
- Password (stored as a bcrypt hash) — must be at least 12 characters and not
  a common password
- Email (optional)
- Groups (default: `user`)

All new users created by an admin are required to change their password on the
next login. The generated password is displayed once and must be shared with the
user through a secure channel.

A user must be assigned to at least one group. Common groups:

| Group | Typical permissions |
|-------|---------------------|
| `admin` | Full access |
| `operator` | View dashboard, approve nodes |
| `readonly` | View only |

### 2.2 Groups and permissions

Permissions decide what a user can do in the dashboard:

| Permission | Allows |
|------------|--------|
| `dashboard:view` | View the dashboard and cluster overview |
| `nodes:approve` | Approve pending nodes |
| `nodes:token` | Issue new runtime tokens for approved nodes |
| `nodes:delete` | Delete nodes from the cluster |
| `users:manage` | Create, edit, and delete human users |
| `groups:manage` | Edit groups and their permissions |

To change permissions, go to **Groups**, select a group, and choose the
permissions for its members.

### 2.3 Activate, deactivate, or delete a user

- **Deactivate**: The user can no longer log in, but their history remains.
- **Delete**: Removes the user permanently.
- **Reset password**: Generates a new temporary password. The user must change
  it on the next login.

> You cannot delete the last active admin user unless recovery mode is enabled.
> The master seed can log in only when no human admin exists or when recovery
> mode is explicitly enabled.

## 3. Node management

The dashboard shows all registered nodes, their status, capabilities, and last
heartbeat. Capabilities shown in the dashboard are the ones the node advertised
in its most recent heartbeat, so they may change at runtime.

### 3.1 Approve a pending node

When a node registers, it starts in `pending` state. Until it is approved, it
cannot claim work.

1. Open **Nodes**
2. Find the pending node in the list
3. Click **Approve**
4. Review or edit the role and capabilities
5. Click **Confirm**

The node receives a runtime token (`rt_...`) and can start claiming tasks. After
the first successful heartbeat its status changes from `approved` to `online`.

> If you are using the dashboard for the first time, make sure you have
> already created a human admin via the bootstrap page. The bootstrap page is
> only shown while no human admin exists.

### 3.2 Issue a new runtime token

If a node lost its token or the token expired, issue a new one:

1. Open **Nodes**
2. Find the approved node
3. Click **New token**
4. Copy the token and save it to the node's `~/.relay/ai-relay-agent.token`
   file

Issuing a new token invalidates the previous runtime token for that node.

Alternatively, if the node still has its `registration_secret`, it can recover
a new runtime token itself via `POST /relay/v2/auth/refresh`. That call also
rotates the registration secret; the node must persist the new one. See
[../node/token-lifecycle.md](../node/token-lifecycle.md).

### 3.3 Delete a node

Deleting a node removes it completely from the cluster:

1. Open **Nodes**
2. Find the node
3. Click **Delete**
4. Confirm

This deletes:
- The node record
- All its runtime and temporary tokens
- Its presence data
- Claims and task ownership references

The node must register again if you want it back.

## 4. Cluster overview

The dashboard home page shows:

- Total nodes and online nodes
- Task statistics (pending, running, completed, failed)
- Active stages and which node claimed them
- Recent artifacts uploaded to the relay
- Recent events from the event bus

Click on a node, task, or artifact to see details.

### 4.1 Built-in metrics dashboard (T-109)

The relay ships a small built-in observability page at
`/relay/v2/dashboard/metrics` (session auth required). It fetches
`/relay/v2/dashboard/api/metrics` and renders:

- Number cards for **nodes total**, **nodes online**, **queue depth** and
  task/stage totals.
- Horizontal bar charts for **tasks by status** and **stages by status**.
- In-process counters (e.g. `relay_auth_failures_total{endpoint="..."}`).

The page refreshes itself every 15 seconds. For a plain-machine scrape
by an external Prometheus server, use the root endpoint `/metrics`
instead (no auth, Prometheus text format). See
[../reference/api.md](../reference/api.md#health--observability--root).

## 5. Security best practices

### Master seed

- Store it in a password manager or hardware token
- Do not share it
- Do not write it into scripts or environment files on worker nodes
- If you suspect it was leaked, reset the relay database and bootstrap a new seed

### Human users

- Give each human their own user account
- Use groups instead of individual permissions
- Deactivate accounts that are no longer needed
- Reset passwords immediately after sharing them with a user

### Tokens

- Runtime tokens expire after 7 days by default
- If a token is leaked, issue a new one for the node
- Service nodes should store tokens in files with restricted permissions
  (`chmod 600 ~/.relay/ai-relay-agent.token`)

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Cannot log in | Wrong username/password or no active admin | Reset the password or enable recovery mode |
| Pending node never becomes approved | No admin clicked Approve | Check **Nodes** and approve it manually |
| Node shows as offline | Heartbeats are missing | Restart the node and check its runtime token |
| User cannot approve nodes | Missing `nodes:approve` permission | Add the user to a group with that permission |
| Lost master seed | Not recoverable | Stop relay, delete the database file, create a new seed, and bootstrap again |
| Master seed login is missing | At least one human admin exists and recovery mode is off | Use a human admin account or enable recovery mode |

## 7. API endpoints used by the dashboard

The dashboard itself is a static HTML page that calls the following endpoints.
You can also use them from scripts or from worker nodes. See
[../reference/api.md](../reference/api.md) for the full endpoint table.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/relay/v2/dashboard/login` | Login page |
| POST | `/relay/v2/dashboard/login` | Authenticate and set session cookie |
| GET | `/relay/v2/dashboard/bootstrap` | First-admin creation page (master seed only) |
| POST | `/relay/v2/dashboard/api/bootstrap` | Create the first human admin (master seed only) |
| POST | `/relay/v2/dashboard/logout` | Clear session |
| GET | `/relay/v2/dashboard/api/me` | Current user info |
| POST | `/relay/v2/dashboard/api/me/password` | Change own password |
| GET | `/relay/v2/dashboard/api/overview` | Cluster overview JSON |
| GET | `/relay/v2/dashboard/api/users` | List users |
| POST | `/relay/v2/dashboard/api/users` | Create user |
| POST | `/relay/v2/dashboard/api/users/{id}/password` | Reset password |
| POST | `/relay/v2/dashboard/api/users/{id}/active` | Activate/deactivate |
| DELETE | `/relay/v2/dashboard/api/users/{id}` | Delete user |
| GET | `/relay/v2/dashboard/api/groups` | List groups |
| GET | `/relay/v2/dashboard/api/permissions` | List permissions |
| POST | `/relay/v2/dashboard/api/groups/{id}/permissions` | Set group permissions |
| GET | `/relay/v2/admin/nodes` | List nodes |
| POST | `/relay/v2/admin/nodes/{id}/approve` | Approve node |
| POST | `/relay/v2/admin/nodes/{id}/token` | Issue new runtime token |
| DELETE | `/relay/v2/admin/nodes/{id}` | Delete node |

## 8. Example: approve a node from the command line

If you prefer scripts over the web UI, use the admin API:

```bash
MASTER_TOKEN="rt_..."  # runtime token of a dashboard/admin node
NODE_ID="V34ETT74"

curl -X POST "http://${RELAY_HOST}:8788/relay/v2/admin/nodes/${NODE_ID}/approve" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MASTER_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "role": "service",
    "capabilities": [
      {"name": "storage.archive.native", "version": "1.0.0"}
    ]
  }'
```

Response:

```json
{
  "node_id": "V34ETT74",
  "status": "approved",
  "token_type": "runtime",
  "token": "rt_...",
  "expires_at": "2026-06-28T14:00:00+00:00"
}
```

## 9. Example: issue a new token from the command line

```bash
curl -X POST "http://${RELAY_HOST}:8788/relay/v2/admin/nodes/${NODE_ID}/token" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MASTER_TOKEN}"
```

## 10. Example: delete a node from the command line

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://${RELAY_HOST}:8788/relay/v2/admin/nodes/${NODE_ID}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${MASTER_TOKEN}"
```
